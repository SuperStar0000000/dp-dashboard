Activating Updates:
===================

To install updates of this plugin via your WordPress admin without manually downloading from DevPress.com, follow these steps:

1. Get your DevPress.com account username and email address ready.
2. Go to the Dashboard page and find the "DP Dashboard Updates" box. If you cannot find it, click on the "Screen Options" tab and tick the checkmark next to the "DP Dashboard Updates" item.
3. Click the "Add Key" button within the box and enter your username and email. (Note: only accounts with active memberships will be accepted.)
4. Make sure the account details you've entered are valid and are followed by, "Your plugin update is active."
5. Go to the Dashboard > Updates page to manually trigger the request for updates. If there is one for DP Dashboard, then one will show. (Note: this step is unnecessary. WordPress will periodically request for updates even without you visiting the Updates page. Also, if you've recently downloaded this plugin directly from DevPress.com then more than likely you are using the latest version.)
